    var additionalPrincipal: Double  // for each payment, user could add additional money to reduce principal
    
    // for the initializer, I set the default paymentsPerPeriod to 12.  I updated it to also set defaults for the downPayment and additionalPrincipal.  They used to be optionals but now they are not. I'm not great with initializers though
